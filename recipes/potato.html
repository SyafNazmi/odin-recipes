    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For those wondering what on earth is going on here, potentially those outside the UK, this dish is a British staple (and yes fellow Brits, 
        I am talking on behalf of all of us right now ðŸ¤£). It's exactly what it says on the tin - a <b>jacket potato</b> (baked potato) with <b>baked beans</b> and <b>grated cheese</b> on top. 
        Yes, it's better than it sounds ðŸ˜‚

    </p>
    
    <h3><mark>Ingredients</mark></h3>
    <p><b>Checklists:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2x large Baking Potatoes (<i>approx 350g/12oz EACH</i>) </li>
        <li>1x 415g/14oz tin of Baked Beans</li>
        <li>100g / 1 cup Cheddar, <i>grated</i></li>
        <li>2 tbsp Butter</li>
        <li>Worcestershire Sauce, as needed (optional)</li>
        <li>Olive Oil, <i>as needed</i></li>
        <li>Salt, <i>as needed</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes on a baking tray and stab them a few times all over with a fork. Coat in a drizzle of olive oil and a good pinch of salt, then place in the oven for 1 hour 20 mins (should be fork tender all the way through at this point). Crank up the heat to 220C/430F until ultra crispy, then remove.  </li>
        <li>Just before the end, add the beans to a pot over medium heat and simmer until they're piping hot and the sauce thickens up.  </li>
        <li>Slice potatoes down the centre and push them open. Add 1 tbsp butter and a good pinch of salt to both. Fluff up with a fork to get the butter & salt in and around the potato.  </li>
        <li> Top with a pinch of cheese, followed by beans, followed by more cheese then finished with a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.</li>
    </ol>
