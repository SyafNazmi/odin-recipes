        <li>2 teaspoons (7g) Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (0.5g) finely ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <b>For The Marinade :</b>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, salt, MSG, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and pickle juice (if you have) until combined.</li>
        <li>Add in the chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes but ideally overnight.  </li>
    </ol>
    <b>To Dredge & Assemble:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl whisk together all of the ingredients and set aside until ready to fry. </li>
        <li>Fill up a 7-8 quart, heavy bottomed pot just over halfway with  vegetable oil, and heat to 350℉ / 177℃. Have a sheet pan lined with a wire rack near the hot oil.</li>
        <li>Strain the chicken from the marinade through a large mesh strainer with a bowl underneath, and reserve the leftover marinade. </li>
        <li>In batches, toss the chicken into the dredge, pressing firmly into the flour to coat every piece, and place the chicken back into the marinade. Add the chicken pieces one last time into the dredge, again pressing firmly to adhere as much as possible. Place on a sheet pan and repeat with the remaining chicken. </li>
        <li>In batches, fry the chicken for 3-5 minutes or until golden brown, crispy and with an internal temperature of 165℉ / 74℃. Remove to the wire rack, lightly season with salt and repeat with the remaining batches of chicken. </li>
        <li>Enjoy with a side of your favorite sauce.</li>
